Let's break this code into parts to understand it. <br>
Here we have a functional component called "MoviesGrid" mainly in charge of displaying all the movie cards, however when it reached the end of the page it didn't show any more movies, so I implemented an infinite scroll to solve this problem in line 31 that returns the length of the data after reaching the bottom.
