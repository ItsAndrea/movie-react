Let's break this code into parts to understand it. <br>
Here we have a functional component called <code>MoviesGrid</code> mainly in charge of displaying all the movie cards, however when it reached the end of the page it didn't show any more movies, so I implemented an <code>infinite scroll</code> to solve this problem in line 31 that returns the length of the data after reaching the bottom. 
<br>
Also very important is the search route, which starts on line 19. At first I wanted to show only movies but I went a step ahead and implemented a search bar. 
The page had an infinite scroll but users didn't have a search tool to give them what they wanted to see. 
<br>
I used the UseEffect hook and wrote a function as an argument. This function is executed by default when the component is rendered for the first time, and then each time the component is updated. I also specified when it should be executed with the optional search and page parameters.
